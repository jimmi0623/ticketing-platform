# üîí GitHub Repository Protection & Setup Guide

This guide explains how to properly set up your GitHub repository with maximum security and intellectual property protection.

## üö® Critical Security Checklist

### ‚úÖ Before Pushing to GitHub:

1. **Review .gitignore** - Ensure all sensitive files are excluded
2. **Remove all secrets** - No API keys, passwords, or tokens in code
3. **Clean commit history** - No sensitive data in previous commits
4. **Verify file permissions** - Check all files are appropriate for sharing
5. **Update copyright notices** - Ensure all files have proper headers

## üîê Repository Setup Steps

### 1. Create Private Repository

**IMPORTANT: Always create as PRIVATE repository**

```bash
# Using GitHub CLI
gh repo create ticketing-platform --private --clone

# Or create via GitHub web interface:
# 1. Go to https://github.com/new
# 2. Set repository name: "ticketing-platform"
# 3. Set to "Private"
# 4. Add description: "Proprietary Ticketing & Event Management Platform"
# 5. DO NOT initialize with README (you already have one)
# 6. Create repository
```

### 2. Repository Protection Settings

Navigate to **Settings > General** and configure:

#### üö´ **Disable Features:**
- [ ] Wikis (uncheck)
- [ ] Issues (uncheck) 
- [ ] Discussions (uncheck)
- [ ] Projects (uncheck)
- [ ] Allow forking (uncheck)

#### ‚öôÔ∏è **Enable Features:**
- [x] Restrict pushes that create files larger than 100 MB

### 3. Branch Protection Rules

Go to **Settings > Branches** and add protection for `main` branch:

#### ‚úÖ **Enable:**
- [x] Require a pull request before merging
  - [x] Require approvals: 1
  - [x] Dismiss stale reviews
  - [x] Require review from code owners
- [x] Require status checks to pass before merging
- [x] Require branches to be up to date before merging
- [x] Require conversation resolution before merging
- [x] Restrict pushes that create files larger than 100 MB

### 4. Security & Analysis Settings

Go to **Settings > Security & analysis**:

#### ‚úÖ **Enable:**
- [x] Dependency graph
- [x] Dependabot alerts
- [x] Dependabot security updates
- [x] Secret scanning (if available)

### 5. Collaborator Access Control

Go to **Settings > Manage access**:

#### üë• **Team Permissions:**
- **Admin access**: Only repository owner
- **Write access**: Core development team only
- **Read access**: Authorized stakeholders only

**Never grant public access or allow external collaborators**

## üõ°Ô∏è Advanced Protection Measures

### 1. Repository Visibility

```bash
# Verify repository is private
gh repo view --json visibility

# Ensure it shows: "visibility": "PRIVATE"
```

### 2. Code Owners File

Create `.github/CODEOWNERS`:

```
# Global owners
* @your-username @team-lead

# Specific protections
/.env.example @your-username
/config/ @your-username @security-team
/middleware/security.js @your-username @security-team
/docs/ @your-username @documentation-team
```

### 3. Issue Templates (Optional - for internal use)

Create `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md`:

```markdown
---
name: Internal Bug Report
about: Report a bug (internal team only)
title: '[BUG] '
labels: 'bug, internal'
assignees: 'your-username'
---

**INTERNAL USE ONLY - CONFIDENTIAL**

<!-- Bug report details -->
```

### 4. Pull Request Template

Create `.github/pull_request_template.md`:

```markdown
## üîí Internal Pull Request - Confidential

**‚ö†Ô∏è This PR contains proprietary code - ensure all reviewers are authorized**

## üìù Repository Configuration Files

### 1. Repository Description

Set a clear but non-revealing description:
```
"Enterprise-grade event management platform - Private Repository"
```

### 2. Repository Topics/Tags

Add appropriate tags (keep them general):
- `nodejs`
- `enterprise`
- `private`
- `backend`
- `frontend`

**‚ùå Avoid revealing tags like:**
- `ticketing-system`

## üöÄ Initial Push Setup

### 1. Initialize Git (if not already done)

```bash
cd C:\ticketing-platform

# Initialize git if needed
git init

# Add remote (replace with your actual repository URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/ticketing-platform.git
```

### 2. Pre-push Security Check

```bash
# Check what will be committed
git status
git diff --cached

# Verify .gitignore is working
git ls-files --ignored --exclude-standard

# Check for any secrets
git secrets --scan
```

### 3. Initial Commit Structure

```bash
# Stage files carefully
git add .gitignore
git add LICENSE COPYRIGHT SECURITY.md
git add README.md
git add package.json package-lock.json
git add server.js cluster.js
git add config/ middleware/ services/ routes/
git add .github/ docs/
git add docker-compose*.yml Dockerfile
git add .pre-commit-config.yaml
git add init.sql

# Commit with clear message
git commit -m "Initial commit: Proprietary ticketing platform

- Core application architecture
- Security middleware and validation
- API documentation system  
- Docker configuration
- CI/CD pipeline setup
- Comprehensive monitoring
- Legal protection files

CONFIDENTIAL: All rights reserved"

# Push to private repository
git push -u origin main
```

```

### 3. Content Review

Review the repository to ensure:
- No API keys or secrets visible
